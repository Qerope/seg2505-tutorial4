# SEG2505-Tutorial4

This repository contains the results of the fourth tutorial assignment for SEG2505. The focus of this assignment is on working with databases in Android, including SQL, SQLite, and Room for data persistence. The tutorials covered both mandatory tasks (in Java) and an optional task (in Kotlin) related to database management in Android applications.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we completed the following tutorials:

1. **SQL Practice: Using SQL to read and write to a database** (Mandatory)
2. **SQLite Database in Java: Storing data with SQLite** (Mandatory)
3. **Testing and Debugging SQLite Database** (Mandatory)
4. **Data Persistence with Room** (Optional - Kotlin)

The goal of these tutorials was to build a strong understanding of how to interact with databases on Android, including using SQL directly, managing data with SQLite, and leveraging Room for better abstraction in Kotlin.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following subdirectories, each corresponding to a specific tutorial:

```
seg2505-tutorial4
    ├── sql-practice
    ├── sqlite-java
    ├── sqlite-debugging-java
    └── room-persistence-kotlin
```

### Subdirectory Breakdown

1. **sql-practice**  
   This tutorial covers basic SQL operations in Android, including creating tables, reading, and writing data using raw SQL queries.

2. **sqlite-java**  
   In this tutorial, we focused on using SQLite directly in Android apps with Java. It involves setting up a SQLite database, performing CRUD operations, and storing data locally.

3. **sqlite-debugging-java**  
   This section is focused on testing and debugging an SQLite database in an Android app. It involves verifying that data is correctly stored and ensuring that the database works as expected.

4. **room-persistence-kotlin**  
   In this optional Kotlin-based tutorial, we explored Room, a persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite. The goal was to simplify database access in Android applications by using Room's ORM capabilities.
